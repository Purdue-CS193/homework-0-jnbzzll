# Jane's First CS193 Homework
- CS 193 is nice because I get to meet other people studying computational sciences!
- It makes me feel more confident in my ability to tackle future classes, even though they might seem difficult.
- There's super cool and relatable instructors
  * I'm from Chicago too!!!
      - Where are all the actual Chicago people. I haven't met literally any yet.
  * I'm a CS + Polisci double major too!!!

    
- CS 193 is not nice to the girlies that are stuck on Windows PowerShell </3
